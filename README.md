Project Description:

**Documentation for the FastCGI Library in Java**

This project provides comprehensive documentation for a FastCGI library implemented in Java. The FastCGI protocol is used to interface web servers with applications, enabling efficient communication and request handling between them. The documentation aims to offer detailed explanations of the library's functionalities, usage examples, and setup instructions for developers looking to integrate FastCGI into their Java applications. 

Key aspects of the documentation include:
- Overview of FastCGI protocol and its benefits.
- Step-by-step guide to setting up the FastCGI library in a Java environment.
- Code samples demonstrating the libraryâ€™s API.
- Explanation of key methods and classes for handling requests, managing connections, and optimizing performance.
- Best practices for using FastCGI with popular web servers like Apache and Nginx.
  
This project serves as a resource for Java developers who want to improve the efficiency and scalability of their web applications by leveraging the FastCGI protocol.
